## Create UDP Server

### Code example

`udp_server.php`

``` php
// Create the server object which listens the 127.0.0.1:9502 port. Set the server type to SWOOLE_SOCK_UDP
$server = swoole_server("127.0.0.1", 9502, SWOOLE_PROCESS, SWOOLE_SOCK_UDP);

// Register the event of receive data
$server->on('Packet', function($server, $data, $clientInfo){
    $server->sendto($clientInfo['address'], $clientInfo['port'], "Server : " . $data);
});

// Start the server
$server->start();
```

As UDP server, it is unlike TCP server and  hasn't the concept of connection. When the UDP server has started, the client can send directly the data to the port 9502 which is being listened. Then the UDP server will call the function registered for receiving packet.

- `$clientInfo` is the information of client. It is a array which contains the ip address and port of client.

- Call the `$server->sendto($ip, $port, $data)` to send data to client


### Run program 

``` bash
php udp_server.php
```
You can use `netcat -u` to test.

``` bash
netcat -u 127.0.0.1 9502 
hello
Server : hello
```
