## Create Async Task

### Background

If you want to execute a time-consuming operation in the program, for instance broadcasting in a chat program and sending email in a web server. These operations would block the program and slow down the program in reuslt. 

Swoole provides the function of async task. You can send the task to a task worker process pool to execute.

### Code Example

`async_task.php`

``` php
// Create the server object and listen 127.0.0.1:9501 port
$server = new swoole_server("127.0.0.1", 9501);

// Set the number of task worker process
$server->set(array(
	'task_worker_num' => 4
));

// Register the function for the event of receiving
$server->on('receive', function($server, $fd, $from_id, $data){
	
	// Send data to the task worker process
	$task_id = $server->task($data);
	echo "Dispatch async task: id = {$task_id}\n";

	// Send data to the client
    $server->send($fd, "Server: " . $data);
};

// Register the function for the event of receiving task
$server->on('task', function($server, $task_id, $from_id, $data){
	echo "Receive new task, id : {$task_id}\n";

	// Return the result of executing task
	$server->finish("{$data} -> finished");
});

// Register the function for the event of receiving task result
$server->on('finish', function($server, $task_id, $data){
	// Handle the result of executing task
	echo "Async task {$task_id} result : {$data} \n";
})

// Start the server
$server->start();
```

The code above is based on `tcp_server.php`. To send task, it needs to register two functions for task event and finish event. And more, it needs to set the num of task worker precess according to your task amount and elapsed time.

> the function registered for finish is optional. There is no need to set this function when the task doesn't return result

### Run program

``` bash
php server.php
```
